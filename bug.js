This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in Expo with a large amount of data. The error message is typically a generic error, such as `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'AsyncStorage.setItem')` or a similar error indicating that AsyncStorage is not working as expected.  This is often because AsyncStorage is not designed to handle large amounts of data efficiently.  It's also possible to encounter issues if the data isn't properly serialized or if there are issues with data persistence.
